		<text>Lunar Veil: Once per round, you are able to cast misty step. Once you do so, you gain 5 temporary hit points.</text>

		<text>Weapon Recall: You can spend a bonus action to summon the dagger back to your hand.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Attunement: This dagger requires you to spend 10 minutes to attune to its special properties. Otherwise, it functions as a regular dagger +1.</text>

		<text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
		<text>	</text>
		<text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>
